# Octahedron

Qualified name: `manim.mobject.three\_d.polyhedra.Octahedron`

class Octahedron(*edge\_length=1*, *\*\*kwargs*)[[source]](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/_modules/manim/mobject/three_d/polyhedra.html)
:   Bases: [`Polyhedron`](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.mobject.three_d.polyhedra.Polyhedron.html)

    An octahedron, one of the five platonic solids. It has 8 faces, 12 edges and 6 vertices.

    Parameters:
    :   - **edge\_length** (*float*) – The length of an edge between any two vertices.
        - **kwargs** (*Any*)

    Examples

    Example: OctahedronScene

    ![../_images/OctahedronScene-1.png](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/_images/OctahedronScene-1.png)

    ```
    class OctahedronScene(ThreeDScene):
        def construct(self):
            self.set_camera_orientation(phi=75 * DEGREES, theta=30 * DEGREES)
            obj = Octahedron()
            self.add(obj)
    ```
