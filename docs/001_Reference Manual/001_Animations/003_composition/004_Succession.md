# Succession

Qualified name: `manim.animation.composition.Succession`

class Succession(*mobject=None*, *\*args*, *use\_override=True*, *\*\*kwargs*)[[source]](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/_modules/manim/animation/composition.html)
:   Bases: [`AnimationGroup`](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.animation.composition.AnimationGroup.html)

    Plays a series of animations in succession.

    Parameters:
    :   - **animations** ([*Animation*](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.animation.animation.Animation.html)) – Sequence of [`Animation`](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.animation.animation.Animation.html) objects to be played.
        - **lag\_ratio** (*float*) –

          Defines the delay after which the animation is applied to submobjects. A lag\_ratio of
          `n.nn` means the next animation will play when `nnn%` of the current animation has played.
          Defaults to 1.0, meaning that the next animation will begin when 100% of the current
          animation has played.

          This does not influence the total runtime of the animation. Instead the runtime
          of individual animations is adjusted so that the complete animation has the defined
          run time.
        - **kwargs** (*Any*)

    Examples

    Example: SuccessionExample

    [
    ](./SuccessionExample-1.mp4)

    ```
    class SuccessionExample(Scene):
        def construct(self):
            dot1 = Dot(point=LEFT * 2 + UP * 2, radius=0.16, color=BLUE)
            dot2 = Dot(point=LEFT * 2 + DOWN * 2, radius=0.16, color=MAROON)
            dot3 = Dot(point=RIGHT * 2 + DOWN * 2, radius=0.16, color=GREEN)
            dot4 = Dot(point=RIGHT * 2 + UP * 2, radius=0.16, color=YELLOW)
            self.add(dot1, dot2, dot3, dot4)

            self.play(Succession(
                dot1.animate.move_to(dot2),
                dot2.animate.move_to(dot3),
                dot3.animate.move_to(dot4),
                dot4.animate.move_to(dot1)
            ))
    ```

    \_original\_\_init\_\_(*\*animations*, *lag\_ratio=1*, *\*\*kwargs*)
    :   Initialize self. See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.

        Parameters:
        :   - **animations** ([*Animation*](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.animation.animation.Animation.html))
            - **lag\_ratio** (*float*)
            - **kwargs** (*Any*)

    \_setup\_scene(*scene*)[[source]](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/_modules/manim/animation/composition.html)
    :   Setup up the [`Scene`](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.scene.scene.Scene.html) before starting the animation.

        This includes to [`add()`](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.scene.scene.Scene.html) the Animation’s
        [`Mobject`](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.mobject.mobject.Mobject.html) if the animation is an introducer.

        Parameters:
        :   **scene** ([*Scene*](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.scene.scene.Scene.html) *|* *None*) – The scene the animation should be cleaned up from.

        Return type:
        :   None

    begin()[[source]](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/_modules/manim/animation/composition.html)
    :   Begin the animation.

        This method is called right as an animation is being played. As much
        initialization as possible, especially any mobject copying, should live in this
        method.

        Return type:
        :   None

    finish()[[source]](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/_modules/manim/animation/composition.html)
    :   Finish the animation.

        This method gets called when the animation is over.

        Return type:
        :   None

    interpolate(*alpha*)[[source]](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/_modules/manim/animation/composition.html)
    :   Set the animation progress.

        This method gets called for every frame during an animation.

        Parameters:
        :   **alpha** (*float*) – The relative time to set the animation to, 0 meaning the start, 1 meaning
            the end.

        Return type:
        :   None

    next\_animation()[[source]](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/_modules/manim/animation/composition.html)
    :   Proceeds to the next animation.

        This method is called right when the active animation finishes.

        Return type:
        :   None

    update\_mobjects(*dt*)[[source]](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/_modules/manim/animation/composition.html)
    :   Updates things like starting\_mobject, and (for
        Transforms) target\_mobject. Note, since typically
        (always?) self.mobject will have its updating
        suspended during the animation, this will do
        nothing to self.mobject.

        Parameters:
        :   **dt** (*float*)

        Return type:
        :   None
